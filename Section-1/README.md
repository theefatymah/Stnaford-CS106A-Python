# 🏥 Section 1 – Hospital Karel | Code in Place 2025

> “You don’t just teach code — you inspire minds, build logic, and spark futures.”  
> — Mah Noor Fatima

Welcome to our **first stop** on the Code in Place 2025 journey! 🌍  
A moment where **14 students across 5 continents** logged in — some at sunrise, others past midnight — all ready to meet their new robotic friend: **Karel**.

As a proud **Stanford Section Leader**, this session was more than a class.  
It was a shared mission to build **computational thinking**, **confidence**, and a **community of future tech leaders**.

## 🎯 What We Did

We kicked things off by diving into the core ideas behind programming through one of Stanford CS106A’s most iconic activities: **Hospital Karel**.

### 🚀 Concepts We Explored:
- 🤖 **Who’s Karel?** — Stanford’s lovable robot for beginners to **learn programming visually**
- 🧱 **Basic Commands** — `move()`, `turn_left()`, `put_beeper()` — the building blocks of coding
- 🔁 **Control Structures** — mastering `if`, `while`, `for` loops with real-time logic building
- ✂️ **Decomposition** — writing modular functions that make your code readable and reusable
- 🧠 **Debugging** — learning that *fixing* code is how you become a real problem-solver

## 🏥 The Challenge: Hospital Karel

This wasn’t just any problem — it was a puzzle with purpose.

### 💡 What We Did:
- 🗺️ **Mapped out** the problem using [Karel Helper](https://karelhelper.com/)
- 🗣️ **Live logic discussion** — students brainstormed step-by-step solutions
- 💻 **Collaboratively coded** and debugged together using the online IDE
- ✅ Reached a working solution using loops, clean structure, and team spirit

This helped every student go from “I’ve never coded before” to “I just built a robot hospital!”
